## ggplot2: Data Visualization (6 points)

Select one of the data sets we have used in class or a dataset that you found elsewhere. _Using ggplot2 graphics_, create a compelling graphic that adheres to the design principles from class. For full credit, make sure to include informative titles and axes labels.

Include a written summary of the story your graphic displays. This should be about three sentences in length and describe the figure, but also summarize the "take away points."
